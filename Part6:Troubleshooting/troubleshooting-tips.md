stablishing a Kubernetes cluster is one thing. Making sure that the cluster stays
operational is another. As a Kubernetes administrator, you are continuously confron‐
ted with making sure that the cluster stays functional. Therefore, your troubleshoot‐
ing skills must be sharp so that you can come up with strategies for identifying the
root cause of an issue and fixing it.
Of all the domains covered by the exam, the section “Troubleshooting” has the high‐
est weight for the overall score, so it’s important to understand failure scenarios and
learn how to fix them. This chapter will address how to monitor and troubleshoot
applications in different constellations. Furthermore, we’ll discuss failures that may
arise for cluster components due to misconfiguration or error conditions.
At a high level, this chapter covers the following concepts:
• Evaluating logging options
• Monitoring applications
• Accessing container logs
• Troubleshooting application failures
• Troubleshooting cluster failures
